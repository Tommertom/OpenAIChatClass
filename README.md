Class
The class in this project is designed to encapsulate the functionality needed for the task. It includes methods for setting up the environment, processing data, and handling responses. The class is designed to be reusable and maintainable, making it easy to update or extend the functionality in the future.

App.ts

It handles the setup, execution, and teardown of the application, making sure everything runs smoothly. It's responsible for controlling the flow of the application and coordinating the class's methods to achieve the desired outcome.
